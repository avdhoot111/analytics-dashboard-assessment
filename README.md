# Hello Team members at Mapup.

# This is dashboard that I created as part of assessment for Frontend Developer role. 

# I have reduced the dataset as page was becoming unresponsive to huge dataset provided.

# The enhancement I can think of are as follows:

- I created the charts based on my understanding. But we may want to further create more insightful charts or cards based on business needs. 

- We can create filters for different parameters, e.g. country, car company, model, etc based on business requirement.
